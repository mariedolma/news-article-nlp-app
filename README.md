# Project: EVALUATE NEWS ARTICLES WITH NLP

This is one of my projects for Udacity's FEND Nano Program!

The goal of this project was to practice with:
- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls
- Creating layouts and page design
- Testing with Jest
- Service workers

We were also expected to use Natural Language Processing for this project - more specifically the "Sentiment Analysis API" from MeaningCloud - allowing users to get an analysis of a text of their choice from articles found on other websites.
With the App I developed, users can use either urls or paste a text to submit for a Sentiment Analysis.

The results provide analysis for:
- Agreement
- Confidence
- Subjectivity
- Irony
